## How to convert the python GUI to a stand alone exe installable file:
=======================================================================
1- pip (or conda) install pyinstaller
2- run this command to create executable python (while working in appropriate directory):
	a- pyinstaller --name YU_LabManager --onefile --windowed --icon=YorkU_icon.ico YorkULabSeating.py
	b- If you get an error about excess recursion: Copy the line of code from the error into "YU_LabManager.spec" as instructed, then run
	   pyinstaller YU_LabManager.spec
3- Once Building has completed successfully, copy the assets folder to dist/YU_LabManager folder
4- install inno setup
    a- use the wizard to create a new software package and follow the instructions. Set to local (not admin) install.
    b- add all asset directories to the project
    c- edit the source in [Files] block: from DestDir: "{app}" to DestDir: "{app}/assets"

[Alternatively]
4a- reuse same .iss file from previous release and only modify the version number all over the file. Make sure to create the new directories with files prior to this step.
5- compile (4th buttom from the top left corner of inno setup application)
6- copy the exe output file to dedicated sharepoint/teams loacation for IT team access
